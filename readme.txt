Description:
Physica is a 2D physics simulation which allow user to experience the real
 world physiscs. The main goal of the game is reaching red flag with a red
 ball. While doing this, user can draw simple objects to collide to move the
 ball, use these objects as a bridge, wall or they can directly apply force
 on the ball by clicking on it.

How to setup:
Our program tested on eclipse 4.3 kepler with java 8 support. It is cross
 platform and tested on Linux Mint 16, Windows 7 and Windows 8. A working
 eclipse 4.3 kepler with java 8 support will do the trick.Also we created a
 runnable jar but it has poor performance.
 Our program needs a strong cpu to run smoothly.


What is working:
The program almost complete. There are few bugs. And options not entirely
 implemented yet. More stages will be added. If time permits, sounds and some
 settings element will be implemented.
